1
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:27.820
Tim Oude Nijhuis: Yeah, and I'm just waiting again to see if the both will join the meeting, because this is getting a bit absurd.

2
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.360
Tim Oude Nijhuis: No, I'm wondering how I'm going to see

3
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.459
Tim Oude Nijhuis: if the both will join.

4
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.059
Tim Oude Nijhuis: It's really just critical to try to get a recording in the

5
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.089
Tim Oude Nijhuis: the software. Like shouldn't be this hard. Okay? So it's 1 18 right now.

6
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.379
Tim Oude Nijhuis: since the boat will you need 2 or 3 min if the bot doesn't join, it doesn't request the request to join

7
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:04.770
Tim Oude Nijhuis: in 2 min. Then I don't know what to do. I'm gonna get myself for now, and we're gonna see what's going to happen.

8
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:15.490
Tim Oude Nijhuis: Hopefully, the butt doesn't join, or hopefully the but does join. But if it doesn't join hopefully, the app will take the recording from our cloud.

9
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.089
Tim Oude Nijhuis: But you know, let's see.

10
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.670
Tim Oude Nijhuis: like myself, real quick.

11
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.260
Tim Oude Nijhuis: So it seems like it's the

12
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.580
Tim Oude Nijhuis: just to prove the both to June right now.

13
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.080
Tim Oude Nijhuis: It's still

14
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.520
Tim Oude Nijhuis: okay. So the board joins. Now let's see

15
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.230
Tim Oude Nijhuis: if the meeting is recorded like. only after the board can join.

16
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.169
Tim Oude Nijhuis: or if it caught anything before that, so

17
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.509
Tim Oude Nijhuis: you can talk a bit about your automation. Your bottom machine means that

18
00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.230
Tim Oude Nijhuis: you're going to find a team that will upload the videos for you. They will create the videos and they will upload the videos for you.

19
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.250
Tim Oude Nijhuis: you can find the team on up work. That's what we recommend. But there are other freelance to.

20
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.900
Tim Oude Nijhuis: But platforms out there that you can use to create. You use the automation team. Now.

21
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.390
Tim Oude Nijhuis: I need the automation. There's a difference between search and browse. The browser videos.

22
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:24.160
Tim Oude Nijhuis: we are specialized in search videos, not to just briefly explain the difference between them. browse videos.

23
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.890
Tim Oude Nijhuis: a video set you to recommend. when you go into it, for example.

24
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:38.510
Tim Oude Nijhuis: like, what is Elen must be doing. you know. Just click that titles like I destroyed this $100,000 house and stuff like that. But

25
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.869
Tim Oude Nijhuis: search videos are different because these are not videos that are recommended by Youtube. Rather they are videos that people search for

26
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.569
Tim Oude Nijhuis: and it search for videos for based on keywords.

27
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.920
Tim Oude Nijhuis: So let's say, you create a search channel based on, you know, online software.

28
00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:11.169
Tim Oude Nijhuis: you expect people to try to find help for them. For example, how to record the meeting with Zoom, how to wait an account on how to upgrade your account on Zoom, or many other different platforms that people need tutorials, or or I just need help. You can go into one of those stations, and I'll put those there.

29
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.919
Tim Oude Nijhuis: Now, I'm going to close this recording. Does anyone have any other questions?

30
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.050
Tim Oude Nijhuis: What time is it?

31
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.210
Tim Oude Nijhuis: How's the weather outside?

32
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.889
Tim Oude Nijhuis: What are the winning lot 3 numbers.

33
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.889
Tim Oude Nijhuis: and with this I could for the call, and they conclude the testing.
